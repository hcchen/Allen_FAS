# PMP 筆記

## General 
### PMP Charts

### The 5 Process Groups

#### Initiating
These processes help you define a new piece of work – either a complete new project or the phase you are about to begin. They ensure you have authority to proceed.
#### Planning
These processes help you define objectives and scope out the work to be done. They also encompass all the work around planning and scheduling tasks. Again, they can cover a complete project or just the phase you are working on right now. Or you might be closing one phase and planning the next in parallel.
#### Executing
You do these processes as you carry out your project tasks. This is the ‘delivery’ part of project management, where the main activity happens and you create the products.
#### Monitoring and Controlling
These processes let you track the work that is being done, review and report on it. They also cover what happens when you find out the project isn’t following the agreed plan, so change management falls into this Process Group. You’ll run these processes alongside those in the Executing Group (mainly, but alongside the other Groups too) so you monitor as you go.
#### Closing
Finally, these processes let you finalize all the tasks in the other Groups when you get to the point to close the project or phase.

### Collect reauirement
Group cerativity techniques:
1. Start gathering requirements by using the **mind mapping technique**. 
Start with a topic, an issue or an area that you want to collect requirements for and develop ideas around it. Group the ideas visually, as a mind map, by writing down each idea and drawing how it relates to the initial topic. Ideally, you let anyone in the workshop create his or her own mind map. 

2. Continue the process with a **brainstorming** session. 
Allow anyone in the workshop to generate an unstructured requirements list for each idea captured on the mind map. To ensure that the brainstorming remains focused on the initial topic, lay basic ground rules and let anyone freely generate fresh ideas and requirements on the topic. 

3. Use the list of unstructured ideas and requirements to build an **affinity diagram**, where your ideas are organized into groups based on their natural relationship. Let anyone in the workshop participate in organizing the items in the most natural group they can. 

4. Identify the most important requirements by applying the **nominal group technique**. Allow each member or group in the workshop to identify which requirements are the most important for him or her. Rank each requirement on the affinity diagram with a priority: low, medium, high or from one to five. To avoid conflicts, facilitate an anonymous priority appraisal and ranking. Finally, tally the results and identify the most important requirements. 

5. Close the process by running several rounds of independent feedback through the **Delphi technique**. Let any individual or group revise the list of requirements. Share an anonymous outcome from each review round and continue with further rounds, keeping in mind the objective to reach consensus and convergence.
